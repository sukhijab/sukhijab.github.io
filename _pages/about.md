Hi! 

I am pursuing a PhD in computer science at ETH Zürich. I am co-supervised by <a href="https://las.inf.ethz.ch/krausea"> Prof. Andreas Krause </a> and <a href="http://crl.ethz.ch/people/coros/index.html"> Prof. Stelian Coros</a>. 
My research interests are Reinforcement learning (RL): model-based RL, nonepisodic RL, safe RL, meta RL, continuous time RL, exploration (multimodal) in RL, active learning and robotics. 

Since December 2024, I have started an internstip at <a href="https://aws.amazon.com">Amazon Web Services</a> in Berlin as a research scientist. Currently, I am working on leveraging RL for fine-tuning LLM agents to master real-world applications.

From July 2024 -- December 2024 I was a research visitor at <a href="https://www.berkeley.edu/">University of California, Berkeley</a> at the <a href="https://rll.berkeley.edu/"> Berkeley Robot Learning lab</a> where I was supervised by <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel/"> Prof. Pieter Abbeel</a>. During the visit, I worked on developing a class of simple, efficient and scalable algorithms for exploration in RL, see <a href="https://sukhijab.github.io/projects/maxinforl/">MaxInfoRL</a>. 

Prior to my PhD I completed a BSc in Mechanical Engineering and a masters in Robotics at ETH. I completed my master thesis at the <a href="https://www.rwth-aachen.de/go/id/a/?lidx=1">RWTH Aachen university</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://baumanndominik.github.io/">Prof. Dominik Baumann</a>, <a href="https://www.dsme.rwth-aachen.de/cms/dsme/das-institut/team/~jlolt/prof-sebastian-trimpe/?allou=1">Prof. Sebastian Trimpe</a>, and Prof. Andreas Krause. I received the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETH_medal#:~:text=The%20ETH%20medal%20is%20awarded,award%20includes%20a%20cash%20prize.">ETH medal</a> for my thesis.

Besides research, I enjoy playing football and support <a href='https://www.liverpoolfc.com/'>Liverpool FC</a>.
