<h1> Globally Optimal Safe Robot Learning Hardware Experiments</h1>
<p> We apply our algorithm to find optimal feedback gain matrix K of a operational space impedance controller for a path following task. 
 The hardware we consider is the Franka Emika Panda seven DOF robot arm. The desired path is depicted in the figure below. </p>

<p> We require the controller to follow the desired path as accurately as possible. This is especially necessary as the path is very close to the wall as depicted in the figure. 
 This simulates a realistic task, where the end-effector is asked to pick an object on the one side of the wall and drop it on the other.</p>
<p> We compare SafeOpt (SafeOptSwarm) with our method GoSafe Contextual. We run only 50 iterations for each algorithm. 
Additionally, we evaluate our methods over three independent runs. </p>
</p>The safe set for the underlying problem is connected. 
 Hence given enough iterations, SafeOptSwarm should be able to discover the global optimum. 
Nonetheless, as we restrict ourselves to 50 iterations, the question we want to investigate is whether global exploration of GoSafe can allow us to learn the optimum earlier.</p>
<p> Below is a video of our hardware experiments. </p>

<p> During our experiments, both approaches provide 100% safety in all three runs. 
 However, as can be seen in figure below, the parameters recommended by our method perform considerably better than SafeOptSwarm. 
This underlines the advantage of global exploration and our method. </p>
