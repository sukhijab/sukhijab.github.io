<h1> Contextual Globally Optimal Robot Learning With Safety Guarantees (GoSafeCon)</h1>
<p> We apply our algorithm to find optimal feedback gain matrix K of a operational space impedance controller for regulation and path following tasks. We perform 200 experiments
for each of the tasks over 20 different random seeds.</p>
 
<h2> Reaching a desired positon (8D task) </h2>
<p> We use the impedance controller to make the robot reach a desired position which lies close to its initial state. The task consists of a 6D state space and 2D parameter space.</p>
</p>We compare our method Contextual GoSafe with SafeOpt. We observe that the safe sets are disconnected in the parameter space. Hence, SafeOpt could get stuck at a local optima if it is 
not initialized well.</p>
<p> Below is a video of our 8D simulation task. </p>

<h3> Following a desired path (11D task) </h3>
<p> We require the controller to follow the desired path as accurately as possible. The task consists of a 7D state space and 4D parameter space. </p>
<p> We compare SafeOptSwarm with our method Contextual GoSafe. </p>
