<h1> Contextual Globally Optimal Robot Learning With Safety Guarantees In Higher Dimensions</h1>
<p>This is a blog about our recent work on GoSafe.</p>
<p>  Safely learning policies from data is a major concern when optimizing directly on hardware systems since even single fault can lead to hardware damage, inducing high costs in terms of money and time investment. 
  Existing methods that can guarantee safety during exploration are either limited to finding local optima or to low dimensional systems. 
  In this work, we build upon the existing GoSafe algorithm to enable learning of globally optimal policies in high dimensional settings while still providing safety guarantees. 
  In particular, we introduce contextual GoSafe and demonstrate its applicability on a real robot arm. </p>
